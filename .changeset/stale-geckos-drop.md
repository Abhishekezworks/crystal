ðŸš¨ TypeScript is now configured to hide interfaces marked as `@internal`. This
may result in a few errors where you're accessing things you oughtn't be, but
also may hide some interfaces that should be exposed - please file an issue if
an API you were dependent on has been removed from the TypeScript typings. If
that API happens to be `step.dependencies`; you should first read this:
