# Graphile GraphQL Monorepo

At Graphile we love GraphQL so much we named ourself for it! This repository
houses many of the Graphile packages that relate to GraphQL; the two headline
projects are **DataPlanner** and **PostGraphile** but there's many other
packages, some of which can be used independently - see below for more details.

**DataPlanner**: A cutting-edge planning and alternative execution engine for
GraphQL.js â”€ write your GraphQL schema with "plans" rather than "resolvers" and
our intelligent engine can optimize execution for incredible performance and
efficiency gains despite very attractive developer ergonomics.

**PostGraphile**: An incredibly low-effort way to build a well structured and
high-performance GraphQL API backed primarily by a PostgreSQL database. Our main
focusses are performance, automatic best-practices and
customisability/extensibility.

## Project summaries

Here's a rough breakdown of the main packages:

- **dataplanner** (see above)
  - **@dataplan/pg** - plan classes for interacting with PostgreSQL
  - **@dataplan/json** - plan classes for encoding/decoding JSON
- **graphile-exporter** - a package that can (under the right circumstances)
  export an in-memory dynamically-constructed GraphQL schema to raw JavaScript
  source code that can be imported and executed
  - **eslint-plugin-graphile-exporter** - an ESLint plugin that helps you write
    code compatible with graphile-exporter
- **jest-serializer-graphql-schema** - a simple Jest serializer that understands
  GraphQL schemas and thus does not fill snapshots with `\"\"\"` etc
- **graphile-plugin** - a module that handles the plugins, presets and
  configuration files for Graphile software - a universal configuration layer.
- **graphile-build** - a system for building a GraphQL.js schema from "plugins",
  particularly useful for autogenerated GraphQL APIs (e.g. PostGraphile uses
  this) but also useful for hand-rolled schemas that have a lot of modular but
  widely-used concerns such as connections, naming, etc.
  - **graphile-build-pg** - plugins for `graphile-build` that understand
    `@dataplan/pg` (i.e. PostgreSQL) data sources and can generate types,
    relations, mutations, etc for these database resources.
- **graphile-lru** - an _obsessively_ performant least-recently-used cache
  (possibly the fastest general purpose LRU cache in Node.js) with a
  ridiculously tiny feature set; you almost certainly want @isaacs' `lru-cache`
  instead of this
- **pg-sql2** - a library for building highly dynamic SQL-injection-proof
  PostgreSQL queries using tagged template literals
- **pg-introspection** - a strongly typed introspection library for PostgreSQL,
  generated from the PostgreSQL documentation to provide up-to-date details of
  each introspection field
- **postgraphile** - pulls most of the above technologies together to build an
  extremely high performance, highly flexible and customiseable, best practices
  GraphQL API packed primarily by PostgreSQL database(s).

Graphile Engine enables you to build high-performance easily-extensible GraphQL
schemas by combining plugins. PostGraphile builds on Graphile Engine to helps
you craft a best practices GraphQL API backed primarily by your PostgreSQL
database in record time.

This monorepo contains the main packages that make up the PostGraphile /
Graphile Engine suite.

## This is (unreleased) version 5!

**IMPORTANT**: this `master` branch shows the in-progress development on version
5 of the Graphile suite.
[For PostGraphile version 4, see the v4 branch](https://github.com/graphile/postgraphile/tree/v4).
Version 4 is still alive and well.

## Monorepo Contents

### [postgraphile][] [![Package on npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/postgraphile.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postgraphile) ![MIT license](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/postgraphile.svg) ![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dw/postgraphile)

Instant lightning-fast GraphQL API backed primarily by your PostgreSQL database.
Highly customizable and extensible thanks to incredibly powerful plugin system.

### [graphile-build][] [![Package on npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/graphile-build.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphile-build) ![MIT license](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/graphile-build.svg) ![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dw/graphile-build)

The core of Graphile Engine: a plugin system that enables you to build a GraphQL
schema out of plugins with advanced performance capabilities enabled via GraphQL
look-ahead functionality.

### [graphile-build-pg][] [![Package on npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/graphile-build-pg.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphile-build-pg) ![MIT license](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/graphile-build-pg.svg) ![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dw/graphile-build-pg)

A selection of graphile-build plugins related to PostgreSQL: schema
introspection, generation of fields and types for all tables, computed columns,
query procedures, etc - if there's certain features you don't want, simply don't
use that plugin!

### [graphile-utils][] [![Package on npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/graphile-utils.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphile-utils) ![MIT license](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/graphile-utils.svg) ![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dw/graphile-utils)

the web layer.

### [graphql-parse-resolve-info][] [![Package on npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/graphql-parse-resolve-info.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-parse-resolve-info) ![MIT license](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/graphql-parse-resolve-info.svg) ![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dw/graphql-parse-resolve-info)

Parses a `GraphQLResolveInfo` object into a tree of the fields that are being
requested to enable optimizations to your GraphQL schema (e.g. we use it in
`graphile-build-pg` to determine which fields are required from the SQL
database).

### [pg-sql2][] [![Package on npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/pg-sql2.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg-sql2) ![MIT license](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/pg-sql2.svg) ![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dw/pg-sql2)

Create highly dynamic SQL in a powerful and flexible manner without opening

## Development

Below is a quick-start, for more detailed instructions, please
[see the CONTRIBUTING.md documentation in PostGraphile](https://github.com/graphile/postgraphile/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

```bash
yarn
yarn watch
```

`yarn watch` will keep monitoring and compiling the babel files, so open another
terminal to run the tests (Note: your PostgreSQL server must be
[configured for logical decoding](packages/lds/README.md#postgresql-configuration)):

```bash
createdb graphileengine_test
export TEST_DATABASE_URL="postgres:///graphileengine_test"
createdb lds_test
export LDS_TEST_DATABASE_URL="postgres:///lds_test"
yarn test
```

If the above succeeds, you're good to go! If not, please try again after running
`yarn install --force` and always feel free to reach out via
[our discord chat](http://discord.gg/graphile) on the #core-development channel.
