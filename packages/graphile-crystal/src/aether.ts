/**
 * The Aether represents the context in which resolvers run; we can assume that
 * all resolvers that run in the same Aether would give identical results for
 * the same inputs.
 *
 * We'd typically like an {@link Aether} to be defined for a single operation
 * execution, but this is hard to determine from inside the schema, and it also
 * prevents certain optimizations such as sharing execution information between
 * identical queries from the same user across concurrent requests. So instead,
 * we consider: what things could cause a plan to have a different outcome?
 *
 * - schema: different schema, everything's different
 * - document/operationName: different operation, different plan dependencies/etc
 * - rootValue: rarely passed, but if it is, it may define a different
 *   runtime context
 * - context: if the context differs, then things like user authentication
 *   could differ, so we may not be able to reuse previous values
 * - variables: if the variables differ, the plans may differ
 *
 * If the schema, document or operationName change, we need a new Aether.
 * Within a single operation execution, we'd expect all of these to be
 * consistent.
 *
 * For `rootValue`, `context` and `variables` it's a little more subtle; we
 * only care about changes to these that affect planning - if there are any
 * diferences that do this then we should use a separate Aether. But if these
 * values are _compatible_ (even if they're not the same) we can use the same
 * aether.
 *
 * Interestingly, this catches the case where a `graphql(...)` execution occurs
 * within a resolver; in that case the operation would differ so we'd define a
 * new aether for it. I believe this is desired.
 *
 * The Aether is used for calculating/caching Batch entries during GraphQL
 * execution.
 *
 * Aether's exist within a `Doc`, so `schema` and `document`/`operationName`
 * are handled already; and the Doc's `getAether` method handles the other
 * concerns.
 *
 * See {@link Doc.getAether} for additional details.
