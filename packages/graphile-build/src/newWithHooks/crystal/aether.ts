/**
 * The Aether represents the context in which resolvers run; we can assume that
 * all resolvers that run in the same Aether would give identical results for
 * the same inputs.
 *
 * We'd typically like an {@link Aether} to be defined for a single operation
 * execution, but this is hard to determine from inside the schema, and it also
 * prevents certain optimizations such as sharing execution information between
 * identical queries from the same user across concurrent requests. So instead,
 * we consider: what things could cause a plan to have a different outcome?
 *
 * - schema: different schema, everything's different
 * - document: different operation, different plan dependencies/etc
 * - rootValue: rarely passed, but if it is, it probably defines a different
 *   runtime context
 * - context: if the context differs, then things like user authentication
 *   could differ, so we can't reuse previous values
 * - variables: if the variables differ, the plans differ
 *
 * If any of the above change, we need a new Aether. But within a single
 * operation execution, we'd expect all of these to be consistent.
 *
 * Interestingly, this also catches the case where a `graphql(...)` execution
 * occurs within a resolver; in that case the document would differ so we'd
 * define a new aether for it. I believe this is desired.
 * The Aether represents a single operation execut
 *  It's used for calculating/caching Batch entries
 * during GraphQL execution.
 *
 * Aether's exist within a `Doc`, so `schema` and `document` are handled
 * already; and the Doc's `getAether` method handles the other concerns.
 *
 * See {@link Doc.getAether} for additional details.
