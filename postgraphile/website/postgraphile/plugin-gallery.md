Below you'll find some small plugins that people have written. Larger plugins
likely have their own dedicated repositories, these are typically just examples
of how to achieve a small goal.

_This is a work in progress, in future these plugins will be automatically
tested but we've not got quite that far yet, so my apologies if you come across
any issues._
