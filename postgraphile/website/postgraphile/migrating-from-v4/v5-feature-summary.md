# Version 5 Feature Summary

One of the main aims for PostGraphile V5 was to replace the cumbersome "lookahead engine"
with something much more pleasant and powerful. After many iterations, we ultimately invented
[Gra*fast*](https://grafast.org/): a new planning and execution engine for GraphQL.

Since the lookahead system underpinned everything in Version 4 of PostGraphile, replacing it
meant rebuilding everything from the ground up, so we took the opportunity to fix a huge number
of other niggles and suboptimal experiences in Version 4 - also adding in many capabilities which
weren't possible, and changing some of the default behaviors.

Ultimately, Version 5 brings a number of new paradigms to PostGraphile, and along with that many
new features. The following list is a summary of those new features but is by no means complete!

# Features new to Version 5

<div class='featureSummary'>

- Lookahead replaced by advanced GraphQL query planning via new Gra*fast* engine
- Every GraphQL request can get an associated plan diagram to ease understanding and debugging compared to complex "look ahead" engine in V4

</details>

- Massively improved SQL query generation: smaller, simpler, easier to understand, more performant, no more `__local_7__`
- Ability to cache certain SQL queries [experimental]
- Ability to easily manipulate query plan so that certain queries are _not_ inlined, improving chance of useful caching
- Polymorphism support, both in the engine and for Postgres autogeneration
- Incremental delivery support [experimental] - now possible to use `@stream` and `@defer`
  - In addition to improving page load times by delaying delivery of expensive fields, this can be used to unlock previously impossible use cases - e.g. streaming huge amounts of data (e.g. to generate CSVs from reporting or similar)
- New "behavior" system allows more precise control over how schema is generated
  - Massively reduces the need for manually removing fields from the schema
- Significantly reduced load on PostgreSQL database
- Connections are no more expensive than lists now unless you use connection-specific features (and even then, they're significantly cheaper than in V4)
  - Thanks to new planning system, "hasNextPage" / "hasPreviousPage" can be achieved by just fetching an extra row
  - No CTE required for "totalCount", uses simple query
  - Cursors are much cheaper
- Export your schema as executable code (no run-time introspection, fewer dependencies, lower memory usage, near-instant startup (great for serverless); helps with understanding how the system/plans/etc works; enables path to migrate away from auto-generated should you later want to)
- makeExtendSchemaPlugin now massively improved
  - No more `selectGraphQLResultFromTable`, `@requires`, `@pgQuery` or other hacks to abstract away the complicated lookahead system. Instead, use straightforward declarative code for all these concerns, integrating deeply and automatically with the Gra*fast* operation plan
  - Extending auto-generated types should always work, independent of plugin order
  - Even if you query remote data sources (e.g. Stripe) in fields within a list, when you come back to postgres everything is automatically re-batched so no introduction of N+1 problem
  - User data and Postgres leaf data (e.g. column values) can be used interchangeably and the planning system will automatically optimize Postgres data (via inlining) if it can
  - Much easier to add "computed columns" in user code, which significantly increases performance by not having Postgres do this work
- Unified plugins: no "server plugins" vs "schema plugins" any more
- Presets: easily share plugin lists and configuration options between servers, and still perform local customization easily
- Consolidated configuration across CLI, library and schema-only usage; no more postgraphilerc.
- Generate personalized documentation based on which plugins/presets you're using:
  - Inflectors, their signatures and documentation
  - Configuration options, their types, and docs
  - Pretty print your resolved configuration to aid debugging
  - (more to come)
- Better Relay support
- Massively enhanced TypeScript support
- Fully implements the latest GraphQL-over-HTTP specification draft
- Ability to perform JOINs in SQL
- No `RETURNING *` on mutations, so column-level select grants don't break mutations
- Write-only columns now supported in mutations
- Use separate transactions in the same GraphQL request - parts of mutations can now use a connection string with elevated privileges without transaction isolation causing these changes to not be reflected in the mutation payload
- Massive enhancements to no-ignore-indexes, including ability to overrule, and only preventing the expensive backwards relations whilst still allowing the cheap forwards relations.
- Overhauled server integration: custom support for major Node.js web frameworks, fits naturally into each of their workflows
  - Even makes use of things like vendor-specific websocket modules (e.g. `@fastify/websocket` or `koa-websocket`) for deeply integrated websocket support
- Theoretically easier to use with other GraphQL servers (assuming that they allow you to replace the 'execute' method)
- Multiple (postgres) databases in same GraphQL schema
- Overhauled introspection; now generated from Postgres documentation and strongly typed (view postgres docs when hovering an introspection value in your editor!), plus much simpler so should work better with other postgres-alikes ðŸ¤ž
- Optionally define your resources (tables, functions, views, etc) manually and generate the schema from them (enables generation from DDL or model objects)
- Use your choice of Postgres client
- Change your PostgreSQL connection string at runtime (assuming you have multiple identical databases - sometimes used for multitenancy)
- Optionally use alternative authorization techniques (don't need to use RLS) [experimental]
- Better support for various Postgres types
- Don't convert unknown types to `String`, instead omit them
- In graphile-build, GraphQL types are registered at "init" time, so `build.getTypeByName` no longer affected by plugin ordering concerns
- Better capabilities for allowing changes to your underlying Postgres tables without causing breaking changes to GraphQL API
- Overhauled inflection system: more consistent, simpler to achieve common tasks
- Use `sql` directly for making SQL fragments, rather than needing `sql.fragment` (reduces code verbosity)
- GraphQL v16 support
- GraphiQL v2 support via Ruru
  - Ruru can be used standalone
- Planning information stored directly into GraphQL schema objects - removing a field now removes all its behaviors (re-introducing a field with the same name will not cause problems like it did in V4)

Future Features:

- Stream/defer (incremental delivery)
- Federation
