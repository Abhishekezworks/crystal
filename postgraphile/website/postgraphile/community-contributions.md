The community contributes to PostGraphile development in many ways.

One of the common ways of contributing is to write a plugin, see
[Community Plugins](./community-plugins/) for a list of some of the plugins that
have been made open source by the community.

Community members also help each other on our
[Discord chat](http://discord.gg/graphile) or through example
code/projects/tutorials/blog posts. Here are links to some of these (use the
"Suggest improvements to this page" link above to suggest more!):

And of course, we couldn't keep progressing this project like we do if it wasn't
for the financial support of many
[community members](https://github.com/graphile/postgraphile/blob/master/SPONSORS.md).
