# Pricing

Businesses that use PostGraphile should
[sponsor Graphile](https://graphile.org/sponsor/) to enable us to keep
maintaining and advancing the software that your company is relying on. However,
PostGraphile is MIT licensed open-source software, so there is no charge to use
it and sponsorship is legally optional (though morally recommended!)

The legacy PostGraphile Version 4 has a "Pro plugin" available; read more
[on the old site](https://graphile.org/postgraphile/pricing/).
