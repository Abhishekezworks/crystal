## PostGraphile V5 Beta Status

PostGraphile Version 5 is about 75% of the way to release candidate stage.
Factors which can increase the rate of release include
adoption and testing by the community and increased sponsorship of the project.

## Milestones

In the first Gra*fast* working group, four major issues were outlined which need to be addressed before a general release of Gra*fast* and PostGraphile Version 5.
The first three of these have now been reached, hurrah!

- ✅ Global dependencies
- ✅ Early exit
- ✅ Eradicating eval
- The polymorphism problem

There are many other areas which will influence moving PostGraphile V5 to release candidate stage:

- We need users to upgrade to Version 5 and test it out on real use cases. You don't have to do this in your live production server &mdash; you can run it on a mirror and see the differences before migration. Most importantly, **you should send us feedback** &mdash; good &amp; bad &mdash; through our [community Discord](https://discord.gg/graphile) or email.
- Smaller issues outside of the above milestones are listed in the [V5 Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/graphile/projects/3) on GitHub. This board is dynamic, new issues get shown here and some of the tasks may be migrated to a V5.1 or later release.
