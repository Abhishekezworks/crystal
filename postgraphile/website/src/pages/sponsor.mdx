Graphile has a number of crowd-funded open-source projects, licensed under the
permissive MIT license, including PostGraphile, Gra<em>fast</em>, Graphile Worker,
Graphile Migrate and Graphile Starter. Sponsorship increases
the rate of fixes, documentation improvements, and feature development on these
and other projects.
