We have a fairly active chat room on Discord:

http://discord.gg/graphile

This is a good place to get help, or to be involved in discussions on upcoming
features in PostGraphile.

Chat, like everything else in Graphile, is governed by our
[code of conduct](/postgraphile/code-of-conduct/), so please be careful to
ensure your language always contributes to creating a positive environment.
