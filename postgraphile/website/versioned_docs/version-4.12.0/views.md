Views are a great solution for abstraction. PostGraphile supports reading from
and writing to views; however PostgreSQL lacks the powerful introspection
capabilities on views that it has on tables, so we cannot easily automatically
infer the relations. However, you can
[use our "smart comments" functionality to add constraints to views](/postgraphile/smart-comments/#constraints)
which will make them a lot more table-like (giving them a primary key so you can
get a `nodeId`, adding foreign key references between views and other views or
tables, setting columns as non-null).

### Abstract Business Logic

We can prepare certain queries in advance and expose the results through
GraphQL. For example, say we want just the `Comedy` films from our `films`
table, we can create a view that contains this specific film type.

```sql
CREATE TABLE app_public.films (
  id serial PRIMARY KEY,
  name text,
  release_year int,
  kind text
);

CREATE VIEW comedies AS
    SELECT *
    FROM app_public.films
    WHERE kind = 'Comedy';
```

And query this view as if it were a normal table:

```graphql
{
  comedies(first: 20) {
    name
    releaseYear
  }
}
```

### Flatten joined tables

Views enable you to expose a simple "flattened" object built from multiple
tables.

```sql
CREATE TABLE app_public.person (
  id serial PRIMARY KEY
);

CREATE TABLE app_public.address (
  person_id int PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES app_public.person,
  country text,
  street text,
);

CREATE VIEW person_view AS
  SELECT person.id, address.country, address.street
  FROM app_public.person person
  INNER JOIN app_public.address
  ON person.id = address.person_id;
```

The GraphQL query using this view is flatter than the query using the underlying
tables:

```graphql
query Before {
  person {
    id
    address {
      country
      street
    }
  }
}

query After {
  personView {
    id
    country
    street
  }
}
```

**_NOTE: you can use [smart comments](/postgraphile/smart-comments/) to change
the GraphQL field name_**

### Authorization

Authorization can be enforced using `views` as well, for example, exposing some
data only to authenticated users:

```sql
CREATE TABLE app_public.person (
  id serial PRIMARY KEY
);

CREATE TABLE app_public.personal_data (
  id serial PRIMARY KEY,
  secret1 text,
  secret2 int,
  person_id references app_public.person (id)
);

CREATE VIEW personal_data_view
  WITH (security_barrier, check_option = 'cascaded')
  AS
    SELECT personal_data.*
    FROM app_public.personal_data personal_data
    WHERE person_id = current_user_id()
```

(`current_user_id()` here is a function that might return something like
`nullif(current_setting('jwt.claims.user_id', true), '')::int`)

### API Layer

Using views, one can create an access layer that will remain consistent even
while making changes to the underlying tables - for example when splitting
tables or combining them. Note that simple name changes can be solved using
smart comments without the need for views.
