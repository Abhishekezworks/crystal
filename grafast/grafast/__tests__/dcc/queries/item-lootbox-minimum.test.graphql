# TODO: Review the plan diagram and experiment with a new way of handling the polymorphism here.
# Lootbox is not polymorphic but Item is.
# Currently (May 2025) the plan has more parallel paths than it should as many of the paths could
# theoretically be collapsed down or deduplicated such that only one path is executed, but not
# using the current way of deduplication due to the way the schema is written.
