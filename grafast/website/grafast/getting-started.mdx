# Getting started

## Installation

Grafast is an alternative execution layer for GraphQL; we still need GraphQL.js
for building the schema, and parsing and validating requests. So the first thing
you need to do to get started is to install grafast and graphql:

```
yarn install grafast graphql
```

or with `npm`:

```
npm install --save grafast graphql
```

Other package managers are available :wink:
