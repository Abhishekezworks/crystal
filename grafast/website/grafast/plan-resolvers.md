# Plan resolvers

When planning a GraphQL operation, we combine the plans from every field
requested in the operation into an execution plan that we then optimize. "Field
plan resolvers" are the functions that detail the plan for each field (there
can also be plan resolvers on arguments, input fields, and even enum values;
but that's more advanced than most people need).

Plan resolvers are synchronous (they must not return promises) since they do
not deal with actual runtime data, instead detailing the steps needed to
process all possible data that will be seen at runtime.

## Field plan resolvers

At operation planning time, each time a field is referenced that field's plan
resolver will be called and the result will be combined into the operation
plan. When calling the field's resolver, <grafast /> will pass the "parent
step" and a "field args" object. The plan resolver may create as many
intermediate steps as it likes, but it must return exactly one step that
represents the result of the field.

In the case of a field that has a polymorphic type, the step that is returned
must be a polymorphic-capable plan (see [polymorphism](./polymorphism.mdx)). In
the case of a field that has a list type, the step that is returned must
produce lists when executed.

A plan resolver can be used instead of, or in addition to, a traditional
resolver. Since plan resolvers run only when the operation is being planned, not
when it is being executed, they do not have access to any data â”€ only other
steps.

Like regular resolvers, the first two arguments to a plan resolver represent the
parent data and the arguments respectively. However, since we're dealing in
potentials rather than concrete data, both of these are a little different:

### Parent step

The first argument, the "parent step," is a step that represents the data from
the parent. When the parent field has an object type, the "parent step" is
simply the step that the parent field resolved to. When the parent field has a
list or polymorphic type, the "parent step" will be the resolved step that
represents an entry from the list or the concrete object type for polymorphism.

### Field arguments

The second argument, the "field arguments" (`fieldArgs`), is an object with
access methods to read the arguments. We'll expand on that below in the
[FieldArgs](#fieldargs) section.

### Example

A plan resolver might look something like:

```ts
function plan_resolver(
  $parent: ExecutableStep,
  args: FieldArgs,
): ExecutableStep {
  const $friends = $parent.getRelation("friends");
  $friends.limit(args.get("limit"));
  return $friends;
}
```

:::note

By convention, when a variable represents a step we start the variable's name
with a `$`.

:::

Of course the actual body of the plan resolver function will vary based on your
own application's needs.

## Argument and input field plan resolvers

:::tip

This section is very advanced and rarely used, so feel free to skip to the next
subsection. It's included here only because FieldArgs (the next section) relies
on these behaviors if present.

:::

In addition to field plan resolvers, Grafast allows you to attach an `inputPlan`
and/or an `applyPlan` to individual arguments or to input fields on input
objects. These plan resolvers work a little differently.

### `inputPlan` plan resolvers

An `inputPlan` plan resolver may exist on an argument or an input field. It is
passed three arguments:

1. the parent plan
2. the FieldArgs relative to this argument or input field
3. additional info (TODO: document)

The `inputPlan` must return a step that shall be used in place of the argument
or input value's raw value when `FieldArgs.get` references it.

### `applyPlan` plan resolvers

An `applyPlan` plan resolver may exist on an argument or an input field. It is
passed three arguments:

1. the target step - the step to apply changes to
2. the FieldArgs relative to this argument or input field
3. additional info (TODO: document)

The `applyPlan` may either manipulate the target step directly, or it may return
a ModifierStep which will gather changes and then apply them all at once. The
ModifierStep is passed to child input fields `applyPlan` plan resolvers (if any)
to allow the changes to stack up. This is particularly useful when building
"patch" objects to be used with a mutation, or "filter" objects to be used
against a collection.

## FieldArgs

The `FieldArgs` object gives access to the arguments of a field (when used in a
field plan resolver) or to the input fields of an input object (when used for
`applyPlan`/`inputPlan`) or similar for other inputs. It contains three methods:

### FieldArgs.get

Pass this method either the name of the argument you wish to get, or a path to
the value you want through arguments and input objects (_but not lists_), and
you shall receive a step that represents that value.

If the argument or input object field has an `inputPlan` method, it will be
called, and the step that it returns will be used instead of the raw step that
would represent the value.

:::note

You may also call `fieldArgs.get()` with no arguments to get the value of the
current argument/input field; but this may only be done inside `inputPlan` or
`applyPlan`.

:::

### FieldArgs.getRaw

As FieldArgs.get, except it ignores any `inputPlan`s and just returns a step
representing the raw value.

### FieldArgs.apply

Pass this method a step to apply to and either the name of the argument you wish
to apply, or a path to the input field you want to apply through arguments and
input objects (_but not lists_), and the `applyPlan` for that argument or input
field will be applied to the given step.

TODO: expand this section with examples of why you might do these things.

## Automatic application of `applyPlan` plan resolvers

FieldArgs keeps track of the arguments/input fields that you `.get()`,
`.getRaw()` or `.apply()`, and should there be any left unaccessed that have an
`applyPlan` method, these will automatically be called passing the field plan
resolver's resulting step as the argument.

This, for example, allows you to associate the "first" behavior with the
argument rather than the plan resolver, such that you could share the
first/last/before/after behavior via a common object that you spread into each
of your arguments on connections, rather than having to rewrite the logic in
each of your plan resolver functions.
