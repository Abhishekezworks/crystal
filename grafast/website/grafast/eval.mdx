Input steps (that is: steps that represent inputs to your GraphQL operations
such as `context()` and steps representing field arguments accessed through
`FieldArgs`) have a suite of `eval*` methods used to constrain query plans
based on the concrete values seen at runtime. For example, if the user has used
the `@skip` or `@include` directives to turn on/off sections of their query,
it's more efficient to have separate plans for this so that we don't overfetch
data:

```graphql
query GetUserDetails($includeFriends: Boolean! = false) {
  currentUser {
    name
    avatarUrl
    friends(first: 100) @include(if: $includeFriends) {
      name
      avatarUrl
    }
  }
}
```

Grafast does this branching automatically by evaluating whether the value of
`$includeFriends` is `true` or not (`$includeFriends.evalIs(true)`) before
deciding which plan resolvers to call. This requirement is then stored as a
constraint on the plan, such that the next request may reuse the plan only if
the result of `$includeFriends.evalIs(true)` retains the same value. Thus this
allows the same operation to actually generate two plans, one for
`includeFriends=false` and one for `includeFriends=true`.

:::note Plans are established on demand

Grafast doesn't plan all possible values of `includeFriends` up front; instead
it just evaluates the version it's currently handling (e.g.
`includeFriends=false`) and will only plan the alternative when a request comes
through for it (e.g. with `includeFriends=true`).

:::

Note that this can result in up to 2<sup>x</sup> potential plans being
generated for the same operation, where `x` is the number of unique
`@skip`/`@include` variables. This reduces the "reusability" of the operation
plans - each time a new request comes through that doesn't match the
constraints of any pre-existing plans, we have to plan the entire operation
again from scratch.

## The `.eval*()` family

It is possible, **but recommended against**, for user plan resolvers to use
this functionality baked into Grafast. All the eval methods have a cost; being
specific about the exact circumstances under which the plan should fork reduces
the number of potential branches and reduces the resulting planning time and
code complexity.

Note that only input-related steps implement any of these methods, and even
then these steps only implement the methods appropriate to them. Tread
carefully.

- `.evalIs(val)` - Branches the plan into two forks: one where `$__inputStep`'s
  value `=== val`, and one where it isn't.
- `.evalHas(key)` - Branches the plan into two forks based on whether the
  specified `key` is set or not.
- `.evalLength()` - Branches the plan into a fork for each length of the list
  seen at runtime.
- `.evalIsEmpty()` - Branches the plan into a fork based on whether the step
  represents an "empty" object (an object with no attributes) or not.
- `.eval()` - Branches the plan into a fork for every possible value - **you
  should almost never use `.eval()` in your plan resolvers**, instead choose one
  of the more specific options above (or, better, avoid `.eval*()` altogether!)

:::info `.eval*()` might be going away!

We are currently _evaulating_ whether to remove `.eval*()` completely from
Grafast in a future version, see [issue
#2060](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/issues/2060).

**If possible, you should avoid branching the plan and instead incorporate the
required logic into your step classes directly.**
