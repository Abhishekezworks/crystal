# Plan diagrams

TODO: add images and more detail

## What they mean

A plan diagram is a directed acyclic graph made of a number of step nodes
connected by arrows which show the flow of data. It also details the LayerPlans
(aka "buckets") and the relationships between them.

### Synchronous steps

A synchronous step is represented by a rectangle, something like:

<Mermaid
  chart={`\
${init}
    Access7["Access[7∈0]<br />ᐸ3.currentUserIdᐳ"]:::plan
    class Access7 bucket0
`}
/>

`Access` is the name of the Step (but with the redundant 'Step' removed - truly it's called "AccessStep").

`7` is the step ID - every step has a unique identifier.

`∈0` means that the step "belongs" to LayerPlan (aka "bucket") numbered `0`.

The next line contains additional step-specific metadata; in this case it's telling us that we're accessing the `currentUserId` property of the step with id `3`.

### Asynchronous steps

These are identical to synchronous steps, except that they have a double border on the left and right (and the run asynchronously):

<Mermaid
  chart={`\
${init}
    LoadOne18[["LoadOne[18∈2]<br />ᐸuserByIdᐳ"]]:::plan
    class LoadOne18 bucket2
`}
/>

### Item steps

`__ItemStep` steps never execute, they're managed by <grafast /> manually to
represent individual entries in a list or stream. They look something like
this:

<Mermaid
  chart={`\
${init}
    __Item15>"__Item[15∈2]<br />ᐸ11ᐳ"]:::itemplan
    class __Item15 bucket2
`}
/>

## How to see them

Your server must be configured to expose plans; if it is then you can use a
tool such as [Ruru][] to view the operation plan, or you can render it directly
from the JSON response. The diagrams are currently built in mermaid-js syntax,
so you can load them into the [mermaid live editor][].
