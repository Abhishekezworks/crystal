# Plan diagrams

A plan diagram is a directed acyclic graph made of a number of **step** nodes
connected by arrows which show the flow of data. It also details the **LayerPlans**
(aka "buckets") and the relationships between them.

## Example

For the following GraphQL request:

```graphql
{
  currentUser {
    name
    friends {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

You might see a plan diagram such as:

<Mermaid chart={mermaidPlan} />

This diagram has two main sections: the **steps**, and the **buckets**. We'll
talk about the buckets first.

:::note

If you're able to convince mermaid to reliably render these two things on the
same diagram in a more independent manner, please get in touch!

## Buckets (aka layer plans)

A bucket, or layer plan, is where data for steps at a similar "layer" in the
operation go. For each layer, the cardinality is the same for every step -
every step deals with the same number of results. Generally buckets are
introduced where this may no longer be the case - for example when we start
handling more results due to processing the items in a list, or fewer results
due to polymorphic filtering or excluding null results from further processing.

Here's an example of a bucket node:

<Mermaid
  chart={`
%%{init: {'themeVariables': { 'fontSize': '12px'}}}%%
flowchart TD
    classDef bucket fill:#f6f6f6,color:#000,stroke-width:2px,text-align:left
    Bucket1("Bucket 1 (nullableBoundary)<br />Deps: 8<br /><br />ROOT LoadOneᐸuserByIdᐳ[8]<br />1: <br />ᐳ: Access[10]<br />2: Load[11]"):::bucket
    classDef bucket1 stroke:#00bfff
    class Bucket1,Access10,Load11 bucket1
`}
/>

### First line (e.g. `Bucket 1 (nullableBoundary)`)

The first line in the bucket node always start with the word `Bucket` followed by the bucket number.
Buckets are numbered from `0`, but during the optimization of the operation
plan the need for certain buckets may be eradicated, resulting in "gaps" in the
numbering. Afterwards comes the reason for the bucket, in parenthesis: `root`,
`nullableBoundary`, `listItem`, `subscription`, `mutationField`, `defer`,
`polymorphic`, `subroutine` or other.

### `Deps:`

A line starting with `Deps:` indicates the buckets "dependencies" - that is to
say the data from the parent bucket that will be copied into this bucket when
it is created, before execution of any of the steps within the bucket
commences.

### `ROOT`

A line starting with `ROOT` indicates the step that represents the "root" of
the bucket, this is often used for checking for nulls/errors and similar
purposes.

### `1:`

Lines beginning with a number indicate the order in which the steps will be
executed in that bucket. Numbered lines with multiple steps listed will execute
those steps in parallel since they are independent of each other.

### `ᐳ:`

Immediately following a numbered line, there may be a line that begins with
"ᐳ:". This indicates the "synchronous and safe" unbatched steps that will be
executed immediately after the numbered line - this is an optimization that
means the system doesn't need to loop multiple times to satisfy these needs.

## Steps

Generally when looking at a plan diagram, you care more about the steps than
the buckets. Each step contains a first line that consists of the step class
name with `Step` removed (for brevity), followed by `[X∈Y]` where X is the id
of the step, and Y is the number of the bucket to which it belongs - the latter
of which is also indicated by the border colour of the step.

Often steps will have a second line of text such as `ᐸ3.currentUserIdᐳ` - this
is metadata specific to that particular step class that gives more detail on
what this step is doing.

The shape of the step's border also reveals more details about the step:

### Standard synchronous steps

<Mermaid
  chart={`\
${init}
    __Value5["__Value[5∈0]<br />ᐸrootValueᐳ"]:::plan
    class __Value5 bucket0
`}
/>

A standard synchronous step is represented by a simple rectangle.

In this example:

- `__Value` is the name of the Step (but with the redundant 'Step' removed - truly it's called `__ValueStep`).
- `5` is the step ID - every step has a unique identifier.
- `∈0` means that the step "belongs" to LayerPlan (aka "bucket") number `0`.
- The next line contains additional step-specific metadata; in this case it's telling us that the step represents the GraphQL `rootValue`

### Asynchronous steps

<Mermaid
  chart={`\
${init}
    LoadOne18[["LoadOne[18∈3]<br />ᐸuserByIdᐳ"]]:::plan
    class LoadOne18 bucket2
`}
/>

These appear very similar to synchronous steps, except that they have a double
border on the left and right. The key difference with these steps, and why they
render more prominently, is that this is typically where your work will take
place - they execute asynchronously, and so can communicate with remote
services and resources.

All step classes you create will generate asynchronous steps unless you
specifically opt them in to one of the optimized forms.

### Item steps

<Mermaid
  chart={`\
${init}
    __Item15[/"__Item[15∈3]<br />ᐸ11ᐳ"\\]:::itemplan
    class __Item15 bucket3
`}
/>

`__ItemStep` steps never execute, they're managed by <grafast /> manually to
represent individual entries in a list or stream (including subscription event
streams). They look like a trapezoid (US) / trapezium (UK) to imply that they
are going from a smaller set to a larger set, though this isn't always the
case.

### Unbatched synchronous steps

<Mermaid
  chart={`\
${init}
    Access17{{"Access[17∈3]<br />ᐸ15.friend_idᐳ"}}:::plan
    class Access17 bucket3
`}
/>

An unbatched synchronous step is a special variant of a synchronous step that
confers no benefit from batching. This allows the system to calculate their
values alongside their dependencies without having to loop multiple times.
Typically they're used for trivial operations such as accessing a named
property from an object or accessing the first/last entry in a list.

## How to see a request's plan diagram

Your server must be configured to expose plans for you to be able to see them;
if it is then you can use a tool such as [Ruru][] to view the execution plan,
or you can render it directly from the JSON response. You can convert the plan
JSON into mermaid format via the `planToMermaid` function so you can load them
into the [mermaid live editor][].
