In the first Gra<em>fast</em> Working Group, we outlined 4 <em>major</em> issues in Gra<em>fast</em>
that needed to be addressed before we could think about general release. The fourth, and final,
Epic has now been reached!

- ✅ Global dependencies — solved via “unary” steps
- ✅ Early exit — solved via “flags”
- ✅ Eradicating eval
- ✅ **Polymorphism — this release!**

In previous versions of Gra*fast* there was the possibility of exponential plan
branching due to the naive method of resolution of abstract types — a known
issue raised in the first Gra*fast* working group as one of four “Epics” to be
solved before v1.0. This release of `grafast@0.1.1-beta.22` fixes this final Epic through
a complete overhaul of the polymorphism system. Let’s take a look!

</p>

### Polymorphism Epic Achieved

By moving the responsibility of polymorphic resolution from field plan resolvers
into the abstract types themselves, we’ve centralized this logic, simplified
field plan resolvers, and unlocked more optimization opportunities and greater
execution efficiency. We no longer have the concept of “polymorphic capable”
steps: any step may now be used for polymorphism. The abstract types now gain a
`planType` method responsible for taking a “specifier” from the field plan
resolver and determining how to resolve its concrete object type and the
associated step.

To solve the problem of exponential branching, we merge the previous polymorphic
branch into a single “combined” step before planning the next level of
polymorphism.

  <code>Animal</code> ID and so they are combined together in order to fetch all

For the few of you who have been brave enough to hand write polymorphic plan
resolvers: first of all, thank you for trying our new system! Hand written
polymorphic plan resolvers will need to be updated to match the new paradigm,
this will involve moving the polymorphic resolution from field plan resolvers
into the new `planType` method on the relevant abstract type and adjusting the
logic to fit the new pattern. Steps such as `polymorphicBranch`,
`pgPolymorphism`, and other polymorphism related steps no longer exist as they
are no longer supported in this new paradigm. For guidance on how to write the
`planType` method, see
[the updated polymorphism docs](../grafast/polymorphism) and please reach
out to us on Discord — we’d love to help you get migrated.

Fortunately, this is the last change to hand written plan resolvers that we
expect to make before the v1.0 release (other than some improvements around
TypeScript types).

### TypeDefs / plans overhaul

In order to make the libraries more type safe, `makeGrafastSchema` (from
`grafast`) and `makeExtendSchemaPlugin` (from `postgraphile/utils`) have
deprecated the `typeDefs`/`plans` pattern since `plans` (like `resolvers` in the
traditional format) ended up being a mish-mash of lots of different types and
`__`-prefixed fields for special cases.

Going forwards, the configuration should be split into `typeDefs` with
`objects`, `interfaces`, `unions`, `inputObjects`, `scalars` and `enums`.
Type-level properties such as `resolveType`/`isTypeOf`/`planType`/`scope`/etc
should now be presented without their `__` prefix; to avoid conflicts with
type-level properties, object and input object fields should be specified inside
a new `plans` property and enum values within the new `values` property.

Migration is quite straightforward:

1. **Add new top-level properties**. Add `objects`, `interfaces`, `unions`,
   `inputObjects`, `scalars`, and `enums` as top level properties alongside
   `typeDefs` and `plans`. Each should be an empty object. You can skip any
   where you’re not defining types of that kind.

1. **Split definitions based on type kind**. For each type defined in `plans`
   move it into the appropriate new property based on the keyword used to define
   the type in the `typeDefs` (`type` &rarr; `objects`, `interface` &rarr;
   `interfaces`, `union` &rarr; `unions`, `input object` &rarr; `inputObjects`,
   `scalar` &rarr; `scalars`, `enum` &rarr; `enums`).

1. **Move field plans into nested `plans: {...}` object**. For each type defined
   in the new `objects` and `inputObjects` maps: create a `plans: { ... }` entry
   inside the type and move all fields (anything not prefixed with `__`) inside
   this new (nested) property.

1. **Move enum values into nested `values: {...}` object**. For each type
   defined in the new `enums` map: create a `values: { ... }` entry inside the
   type and move all values (anything not prefixed with `__`) inside this new
   (nested) property.

1. **Remove `__` prefixes**. For each type across
   `objects`/`interfaces`/`unions`/`interfaceObjects`/`scalars` and `enums`:
   remove the `__` prefix from any methods/properties.

Example:

```diff
 typeDefs: ...,
-plans: {
+objects: {
   User: {
-    __isTypeOf(v) {
+    isTypeOf(v) {
       return v.username != null;
     },
    plans: {
       fieldName($source, fieldArgs) {
         // ...
       },
+    },
   },
+},
+interfaces: {,
   MyInterface: {
-    __resolveType($specifier) {
+    resolveType($specifier) {
       // ...
     }
   }
+},
+enums: {
   MyEnum: {
     ONE
     TWO
     THREE
   }
 },
```

Other changes:

- `ObjectPlans`/`GrafastPlans`/`FieldPlans`/`InputObjectPlans`/`ScalarPlans` all
  changed to singular
- `InterfaceOrUnionPlans` split to `InterfacePlan`/`UnionPlan` (identical
  currently)
- Shape of `ObjectPlan`/`InterfacePlan`/`UnionPlan` has changed;
  `DeprecatedObjectPlan`/etc exist for back-compatibility
- `FieldArgs` can now accept an input shape indicating the args and their types
- `FieldPlanResolver<TArgs, TParentStep, TResultStep>` has switched the order of
  the first two generic parameters:
  `FieldPlanResolver<TParentStep, TArgs, TResultStep>` — this is to reflect the
  order of the arguments to the function. Also null has been removed from the
  generics.
- Various generics (including `GrafastFieldConfig`) that used to take a GraphQL
  type instance as a generic parameter no longer do — you need to use external
  code generation because TypeScript cannot handle the dynamic creation.
- `GrafastFieldConfig` last two generics swapped order.
- `GrafastArgumentConfig` generics completely changed

### New Features

#### Steps

- Coalesce: Accepts a number of steps and represents the first one of them that
  isn’t nullish

#### Step Classes

- Experimental support for adding “references” to other steps at plan-time only
  (via `refId = this.addRef($step)` and reciprocal `$step = this.getRef(refId)`
  methods). Useful for optimization; but use with great caution. Currently
  undocumented due to experimental nature.
