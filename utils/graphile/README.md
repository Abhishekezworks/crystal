# graphile

Graphile makes a number of open source projects, some of the headline projects
include [PostGraphile](https://postgraphile.org),
[Graphile Worker](https://github.com/graphile/worker),
[Graphile Migrate](https://github.com/graphile/migrate) and
[Gra*fast*](https://grafast.org), but there are many others. This module is
intended to be a CLI that will help when interacting with these various
projects, helping you to create, debug, update, interact with and maintain them.

At the moment, it doesn't contain much, but it should grow over time.

## `graphile config print`

Prints out the configuration from your `graphile.config.mjs` (or similar) file
in an easy to read/digest form.

## `graphile config options`

Indicates the full list of options that you may specify in your config file.
