non-transferable, non-sublicensable, license to run the Software for 30 calendar
days. Graphile Ltd may revoke this license at any time, for any (or no) reason,
with no requirement to give you advance notice.

You can use the Software on as many machines as You want, for Your own use.

Your license terminates automatically at the end of those 30 calendar days.

If you have previously used the Software, You do not get another free trial
