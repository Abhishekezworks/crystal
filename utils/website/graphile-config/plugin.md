# Graphile Config Plugin

Target Audience: plugin authors ðŸ”Œ and library authors ðŸ“š

Plugins allow you to extend the functionality of libraries that use Graphile
Config. Each library that uses Graphile Config may register plugin scopes that
enable expanded functionality, including through [middleware](#middleware).

Beyond these scopes, a Graphile Config Plugin has the following properties:

- `name` (`string`): The name of the plugin. This must be unique among all
  plugins that a library user uses with a library. Thus, names should be
  descriptive to limit conflicts and confusion with other plugins in that
  library's ecosystem. Names are used to deduplicate plugins in the
  [preset resolution algorithm](./preset.md#preset-resolution).
- `version` (optional `string`): a semver-compliant version for the plugin. This
  would normally match the version in the `package.json`, but it does not need
  to (e.g. if the module in question contains multiple plugins). Today, this
  isn't used for much. It is only displayed in the output of
  `graphile config print`, but it may be used in the future to allow plugins to
  express dependencies on other plugins.
- `description` (optional `string`): human-readable description of the plugin in
  [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) (markdown) format.
- `provides` (optional `string[]`): an optional list of "feature labels" that
  this plugin provides. This is used to govern the order in which the plugin is
  registered. Graphile Config will append the plugin name to any feature labels
  here. See [Plugin order](#plugin-order)
- `after` (optional `string[]`): indicates that this plugin should be loaded
  after plugins with these feature labels if these feature labels are present in
  other plugins in the preset.
- `before` (optional `string[]`): indicates that this plugin should be loaded
  before plugins with these feature labels if these feature labels are present
  in other plugins in the preset.

## Plugin order

Plugins are ordered first according to the
[preset resolution algorithm](./preset.md#preset-resolution). Consider the
following presets:

```ts title=some-default-preset.ts
import type {} from "graphile-config";
import PluginA from "./plugin-a";

const preset: GraphileConfig.Preset = {
  plugins: [PluginA],
};

export default preset;
```

```ts title=graphile.config.ts
import type {} from "graphile-config";
import PluginB from "./plugin-b";
import PluginC from "./plugin-c";
import SomeDefaultPreset from "./some-default-preset";

const preset: GraphileConfig.Preset = {
  extends: [SomeDefaultPreset],
  plugins: [PluginB, PluginC],
};

export default preset;
```

If you use the preset in `graphile.config.ts` and none of the plugins specify
`before` or `after` then the resolved plugins will typically be loaded in the
order `[PluginA, PluginB, PluginC]`; however, this ordering is not guaranteed
and should not be relied upon.

If the order in which a plugin is loaded is significant, it must be stated
explicitly by adding to a plugin's `before` and `after` properties. These
properties guarantee its loading position relative to other plugins that provide
those features.

If multiple different plugins provide the same feature they should indicate this
via the `provides` property, thereby allowing other plugins to guarantee their
position relative to all the plugins providing this feature with a single
feature label in `before` or `after`.

For example, imagine `PluginD` and `PluginE` each include implementations of a
subscriptions feature. By including the `subscriptions` feature label in their
`provides` property, `PluginD` and `PluginE` allow `PluginF` to ensure it is
loaded before any plugin that provides subscriptions by setting
`before: ['subscriptions']`.

:::note Unknown features are ignored.

Adding a feature label to `before` or `after` does not guarantee that that
feature label is present in a preset; if a feature label is not provided by any
plugins then it will have no impact on ordering.

There currently is no standard way for a plugin to declare explicit dependencies
on other plugins.

## Middleware

Adding middleware to a plugin allows you to add your own code to be run at
specific points in the library's execution. Libraries most often call middleware
in the context of some underlying action. Libraries include an `event` object
which is passed to your middleware function alongside a `next` callback
function.

By adding middleware to a plugin, you can:

- run logic before the library's underlying action by including code before
  `next()`.
- run logic after the library's underlying action by including code after
  `next()` but before returning.
- (if supported by the library and other middleware) omit calling the underlying
  action and following middleware by not calling `next()`.
- (if supported by the library and other middleware) call the underlying action
  and following middleware more than once by calling `next()` twice.
- (if supported by the library and other middleware) mutate the `event` object.
  The mutated event object may be used by other middleware registered with the
  same action name. The mutated event object may also

The following example plugin includes middleware that adds a naive retry and
backoff to the underlying action. Note that this example would only be safe if
the library and other middleware explicitly supported calling `next()` more than
once.

```ts title="my-some-action-retry-plugin.ts"
export const MySomeActionRetryPlugin: GraphileConfig.Plugin = {
  name: "MySomeActionRetryPlugin",
  myScopeName: {
    middleware: {
      async someAction(next, event) {
        console.log(`someAction(someParameter=${event.someParameter}) called`);

        let error!: Error;
        for (let attempts = 0; attempts < 3; attempts++) {
          if (attempts > 0) {
            // Wait a few milliseconds before trying again
            await sleep(attempts * 5);
          }
          try {
            return await next();
          } catch (e) {
            error = e;
          }
        }
        throw error;
      },
    },
  },
};
```

Middleware functions are executed when libraries call `middelware.run()` or
`middleware.runSync()`. For example:

```ts
await middleware.run(
  "someAction", // The "action name"
  { someParameter: 42 }, // The `event` object
  async (event) => {
    // The "underlying action"
    // This function is what will be retried if the MySomeActionRetryPlugin is
    // included in a preset.
  },
);
```

Multiple plugins in a preset can register middleware for the same action. When
middleware functions call `next()`, the next registered middleware is run. Once
there are no more registered middleware functions for that action, `next()` will
perform the underlying action that the library defines.

**Most libraries and most middleware will not function correctly if you omit
`next()`, call `next()` more than once, or change the `event` in an unexpected
way.** Refer to the documentation for the appropriate library to see the
available actions around which you can add middleware, the structure of the
`event`, and whether the middleware are
[synchronous or asynchronous](#synchronous-middleware).

:::note The underlying procedure might be a no-op

Some libraries may call middleware with no underlying action (aka no operation
or "no-op"); typically this allows for middleware to be called at a "point in
time" rather than _around_ a specific procedure. This has no effect on how you
should write a middleware function for these actions.

:::

### Synchronous middleware

Libraries use `middleware.runSync()` when the underlying action is synchronous
and the library expects any middleware function run around that action to be
synchronous. If you return a promise from a synchronous middleware function,
Graphile Config will throw an error.

Libraries should document whether their middleware are synchronous or
asynchronous, but you may be able to tell from the library's TypeScript types:
asynchronous middleware functions' return types generally incorporate `Promise`
or `PromiseLike`.

Unless you are certain a given middleware supports promises, you should not use
`async`/`await`. Instead, use `next.callback(...)` if you need to execute some
code once the action is complete.

### `next.callback()`

`next.callback()` simplifies including code after `next`, regardless of whether
`next` succeeds or fails.

Using `next.callback()` also allows you to introduce a promise only if one is
already present. This lets you avoid the performance overhead of promises when
they are not necessary, and it allows your function to be used as either
synchronous or asynchronous middleware.

```ts
export const MySpecialPlugin: GraphileConfig.Plugin = {
  name: "MySpecialPlugin",
  libraryName: {
    middleware: {
      someAction(next, event) {
        console.log(`someAction(someParameter=${event.someParameter}) called`);
        // Optionally mutate event
        event.someParameter = event.someParameter * 2;

        return next.callback((error, result) => {
          if (error) {
            console.error(`someAction() threw ${error}`);
            // Handle the error somehow... Or just rethrow it.
            throw error;
          } else {
            console.log(`someAction() returned ${result}`);
            // Return `result` or a derivative thereof
            return result / 2;
          }
        });
      },
    },
  },
};
```

### Middleware order

Most middleware are registered and executed in
[the order the plugins are loaded](#plugin-order). Sometimes, middleware in the
same plugin have varying requirements for when they are run. For this reason,
middleware also support `before`, `after`, and `provides`. These properties
function similarly to how they are used to [order plugins](#plugin-order), but
Graphile Config uses them to individually sort the middleware for each scoped
action.

In the following example, the `bar` middleware in the `libraryName` scope has an
order constraint at the middleware level. The `bar` middleware in `MyPlugin`
will be run after the `bar` middleware in `OtherPlugin` if both plugins are used
in the same resolved preset.

```ts
export const MyPlugin: GraphileConfig.Plugin = {
  name: "MyPlugin",
  // Plugins can have order constraints at the plugin level and at the
  // middleware level. All middleware in MyPlugin will be executed before any
  // middleware in plugins that have `provides: ["featureA" ]`
  before: ["featureA"],
  libraryName: {
    middleware: {
      foo(next) {
        // ... do something
        return next();
      },
      bar: {
        after: ["featureB"],
        callback(next) {
          // ... do something
          // Will be executed after middleware that set
          // `provides: ['featureB']`
          return next();
        },
      },
      // ... any other middleware
    },
  },
};

export const OtherPlugin: GraphileConfig.Plugin = {
  name: "OtherPlugin",
  libraryName: {
    middleware: {
      bar: {
        provides: ["featureB"],
        callback(next) {
          // ... do something
          return next();
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

Similar to plugins' `provides` property, Graphile Config appends the plugin
`name` to the `provides` property for all middleware.

## Adding config options

Plugins can add additional config options with
[declaration merging](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html).
Exactly what interfaces you need to extend will depend on how the library author
has organized the types. For example, if you want to add an option to the
`worker` scope used in
[Graphile Worker](https://github.com/graphile/worker/blob/aa417401838e010ef92c63e15a3173ee494eaae2/src/index.ts#L62),
you need to extend `GraphileConfig.WorkerOptions`:

```ts
declare global {
  namespace GraphileConfig {
    interface WorkerOptions {
      myNewConfigOption?: string;
    }
  }
}
```

You can also add a new scope:

```ts
declare global {
  namespace GraphileConfig {
    interface SendgridOptions {
      apiKey?: string;
    }

    interface Preset {
      sendgrid?: SendgridOptions;
    }
  }
}
```

The options you add should be optional. If the file containing these additions
to the `GraphileConfig` types is imported, but the plugin is not used in the
preset, the interfaces are still extended. Additionally, even if you want to
ensure that the **resolved** preset has some value for some option, you do not
want to force every (unresolved) preset to have a value.

If you are building a plugin to share with others, you may also want to export a
preset that sets options to sensible defaults or uses secrets from environment
variables.

```ts title=my-sendgrid-plugin.ts
declare global {
  namespace GraphileConfig {
    interface SendgridOptions {
      apiKey?: string;
      someOtherOption?: number;
    }

    interface Preset {
      sendgrid?: SendgridOptions;
    }
  }
}

export const MySendgridPlugin: GraphileConfig.Plugin = {
  name: "MySendgridPlugin",
  libraryName: {
    middleware: {
      foo(next, event) {
        new SendgridSdk(
          // This assumes that the library passes in the resolved preset via
          // the event object. This will vary depending on the library.
          event.ctx.resolvedPreset.sendgrid.apiKey,
        ).makeSomeCall();
      },
    },
  },
};

export const MySendgridPreset: GraphileConfig.Preset = {
  plugins: [MySendgridPlugin],
  sendgrid: {
    apiKey: process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY,
    someOtherOption: 2,
  },
};
```
